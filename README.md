# Multiple Features

## Description

This tutorial contains a WiX project with two features:

- one that deploys a single file: "dummy.txt".
- and another feature creates a value in Windows Registry.

## How to use

### a) Tutorial (article)

-  TBD

### b) Code example

- [sources](sources)
- I provided the complete Visual Studio solution that solves the described problem. Use it if you need to test it by yourself, in your environment or if you have further ideas that you want to verify.

### c) Code notes

- TBD

### d) Log file examples

- [doc/logs](doc/logs)
- Sometimes a quick look into the log files may be useful, but running the installer each time is cumbersome. I generated the log files for the meaningful scenarios and I placed them into this directory. Have a look when needed.
