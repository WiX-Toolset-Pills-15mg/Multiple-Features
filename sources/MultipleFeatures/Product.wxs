        This is a demo of how to create multiple features.
        
        A feature is the smallest unit that can be selected by the user to be installed.
        At run time, the user can decide which features to install.
        
        If chosen for installation, a feature will install all its components.
        There is no way to install just a subset of its components.
        If this is needed, multiple features must be created.
