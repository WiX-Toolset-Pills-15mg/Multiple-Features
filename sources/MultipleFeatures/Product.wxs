====================================================================================================
START: Overview
====================================================================================================

This pill demonstrates how to create two features and decide at runtime if all or only one of them
to be installed.

A feature is the smallest unit that can be selected by the user to be installed. At run time, the
user can decide which features to install.

If chosen for installation, a feature will install all its components. There is no way to install
just a subset of its components.

NEXT: TBD
